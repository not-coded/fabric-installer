# fabric-installer
An Installer for Fabric, modified to use an alternative meta server hosted by ~~CombatReforged~~ RizeCookey.

Use this to install Fabric Loader for the Combat Tests. 

Changed to use [RizeCookey's meta](https://meta.rizecookey.net) instead of [CombatReforged's meta](https://meta.combatreforged.com).

And changed fabric api link to [RizeCookey's fabric api release](https://github.com/rizecookey/fabric/releases/).
